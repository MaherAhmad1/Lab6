# Internet Architecture

### Internet Protocol
An IP adress is the unique numbers assigned to every computer and device that is connected to the internet, and the difference among IPv4 and IPv6 is that IPv4 is the original pool of available unallocated addreses for the original IP, while IPv6 is the upgraded versionthat allows the next generation of internet protocol to be used which also has a massively bigger space than IPv4. ICANN is a non-profit partnership of people from around the world and is contributing by dedicating to keeping the internet secure, stable, and interoperable. 

### TCP/IP
"TCP/IP stands for “Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol”. It is basically a network protocol that defines the details of how data is sent and received through network adapters, hubs, switches, routers and other network communications hardware." The purpose of it is to connect government computers to eachother through a global, fault, tolerant, network. The client server model extends to this as well because just like a phone call someone must dial and someone must answer but in this case someone wants to connect to a server (dial) and the server must connect them (answer). Layers are important to changing technology because it gives you the ability to change one layer without affecting the other layers. The typed of applications that are run on the application layer are DNS, NFS, TCP/IP, UNIX, and SNMP are a few examples. 

### Internet Security
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol that is used for viewing web pages on the internet. HTTP supports the client server model by allowing you to use HTTP to get onto the web server of your choice which is then transfered over the public internet. The protocols used for protecting data are is HTTPS which is just Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure and this is a different version that uses SSL/TSL protocol to encrypt and authenitcate data. 

### Securing Your Web Browser
You should secure your browser so people do not gain remote access to your computer or because some sites are not safe and will install spyware onto your hardware without you knowing. One risk is ActiveX which gives the user the ability to use parts of an applications or the whole app to be utilized by a website. The risk of using ActiveX is that it has a very long history of being plagued with viruses and vulnerabilities and will likely continue to because hackers can gain remote acces to your system through ActiveX and can then proceed to do whatever they want.
